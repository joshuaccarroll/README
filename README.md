# Hi! I'm Josh.
### And I'm an Engineering Manager at [Creative Market](https://creativemarket.com).

It's really hard to work for/with somebody you can't read. This document exists to help you read *me*. (See what I did there?) I hope it is helpful to you. If it is not, or if you feel I am misstating something here, let me know. Or, better yet, clone this repo, create a branch, and give me a PR. _This is a work in progress, as am I._

## TL;DR:
* I love Creative Market, and it is my passion to help engineers grow and thrive here.
* I am a big picture guy who needs the _why_ before the _what_ and the _how_.
* I can sometimes get carried away and talk too much in a meeting.
* I am logical and action oriented. I prefer to think (which I usually do out loud) before making decisions, but then I want to act quickly.
* I am a husband/dad/foster dad with many creative hobbies. I recharge my batteries by finding solitude, reading, writing, making things, and (ironically for an introvert) performing.

## My work vision
_Here's what I'm focused on, the reasons I do the things I do at Creative Market._

1. I wholeheartedly believe in this company and its product, and I want to leave both better each day than they were the day before. I love working here, and I am committed to Creative Market's long-term success. 
2. It is my job and my privilege to work everyday toward building [a world-class engineering team](https://medium.com/building-creative-market/what-makes-a-world-class-engineer-557cc6d717cc). And so I work to help individual engineers improve themselves in strategic ways. Better engineers raise the level of the entire team, and in turn, the company and the product.
3. I believe the best ideas for how to improve a thing often come from the people who are in the weeds building that thing. Got an idea? I want to hear it.
4. The best engineers (and designers and content writers and product managers, etc.) are those who care deeply about the product and do not wait for someone to ask them to make it better. If you see something we need to improve, I want to empower you to make it happen.
5. Something magical happens when a person's passions and skills align with company needs. So I will ask my engineers questions like "What would you work on if nobody was telling you what to do?" and I will ask execs, designers, and product managers questions like "What project would you start if you had an engineer to build it?" If there's alignment and it makes sense, I will work hard to connect the right people to the project.

## My areas of focus
_Over the years, I've gained some expertise around a few topics in the CM Engineering org. Here they are:_
1. Security. I have worked extensively with both app engineers and web ops to shore up our security from an application and infrastructure perspective.
2. QA. We are constantly improving our QA process, and I'm often involved in those conversations. If you have questions, comments, suggestions, or complaints, please bring them to me.
3. The relationship between Product/Marketing and Engineering. Ultimately, we engineers are here to build an incredible product, but that can't happen if we are not on the same page with our Product and Marketing teams. If something feels off there, please let me know, and I will work hard to make it right.
4. Back end code modernization. You know our tech debt. Let's fix it together.

## What I don't do
_I do a lot of things at Creative Market, but not everything._
1. Tell you how to do your job. You were hired to be an expert, and you have my trust. I will give you feedback, but I will not micromanage.
2. Code. Okay, I might occasionally jump in to support a project, but if that happens, it's a bug, not a feature.
3. Set product process. I work really tightly with our Product team to ensure both PMs and engineers are set up for success, but they are in charge of how our tools are used and how our sprints are run.

## How I communicate
_I have quirks. Here they are._

1. **I will do my best to communicate with you in a way that sets you up for success.** If you need me to be more direct, I will do so. If you need me to give you more encouragement, I am happy to oblige. If something isn't feeling right about the way I am working/communicating with you, let me know, and I will adjust.
2. **I will not lie.** There may be times that I am required to withhold information. That's the nature of the job. But I will not be dishonest with you.
3. **I do not speak between the lines.** Please do not read between them. I will be direct when giving feedback. If you think you are hearing something implied that I am not explicitly saying, you are always welcome to ask.
4. **I despise passive aggression.** I will not be passive agressive with you. Ever. And I ask the same in return. If you have a beef with me or another coworker, _that is 100% okay._ Let's talk it out. If the problem is with me, I will thank you for your feedback and work to resolve the issue with you and be better. That is my promise. If the problem is with someone else, I will give you direction/advice on how to resolve it, and I will even facilitate a discussion if that would be helpful. But you should know that I will also ask if you have spoken to that person directly, and if you have not, I will encourage you to do so. Direct peer feedback is incredibly valuable, and you should not withhold it.
5. **I need the _why_ before I can understand the details.** If you ask me to help you think through some code (and you should!), I will first need to understand what the project is supposed to accomplish before I will be capable of thinking about syntax, patterns, or strategy. Most people start with _what_, then go to _how_, and end up at _why_. My brain works the other way around.
6. **I tend to think out loud.** This means that sometimes I am just throwing ideas at the wall rather than giving orders. It means that I may ramble. I am working to get better at (A) stating clearly whether I am dreaming or giving direction, (B) staying focused on the topic at hand, and (C) speaking concisely. If you feel I am getting off track (especially in a 1:1), you have my permission to (please) interrupt me. I value correction, and I will thank you for it.
7. **When I get excited, I can sometimes steamroll a conversation.** And that's not okay. I have been working for a long time to overcome _Habit #2: Adding too much value_, "The overwhelming desire to add [my] two cents to every discussion" from [this book](https://www.amazon.com/What-Got-Here-Wont-There-ebook/dp/B000Q9J128). I have come a long way, but in the past I have been known to front-load my opinions before giving others a chance to share theirs, ask questions only so I could share my answers, or interrupt and finish somebody else's sentence (often incorrectly) when I agree with what (I think) they are saying. Know that, if I do any of these things, it comes from my enthusiasm and not some malignant place. But it is also not acceptable. So if you see me falling into these bad habits, please raise a hand and/or interrupt me and say "Josh, you're doing that thing again." I want to get better, and I value your help.


## My personality
_I am a sucker for personality tests, and I think personality types are fascinating. Here's more than you could possibly want to know about mine._

1. The Sorting Hat sorted me into [Gryffindor](https://www.pottermore.com/collection/all-about-gryffindor).
2. My top five strengths according to Strengths Finder are: [Intellection](http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/691/intellection.aspx), [Ideation](http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/679/ideation.aspx), [Strategic](http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/718/strategic.aspx), [Connectedness](http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/649/connectedness.aspx), [Maximizer](http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/697/maximizer.aspx)
3. My Myers-Briggs type is [INTP-A](https://www.16personalities.com/intp-personality) (Individual traits: Introverted – 51%, Intuitive – 80%, Thinking – 58%, Prospecting – 69%, Assertive – 71%).
4. If you're into the Enneagram, I'm a 4 with a strong 3 wing. I'm not a drama queen, and I lean heavily on logic over feelings (see my Myers-Briggs), but otherwise, this has been very helpful in my journey to understand myself.
5. I am a weird mix of introvert and extravert. I recharge in solitude, and I prefer small, intimate gatherings of close family and friends to social events, large family gatherings, meetups, and parties. But I am also totally comfortable being on stage, whether that's public speaking or making music.

## I have a life beyond work
_And it's a little crazy._


1. My wife and I have been married for almost 17 years, and we're finally beginning to figure each other out. A little. :)
2. We have two biological daughters and two foster daughters. The youngest is an infant, the oldest is 13. If I seem tired, this is why.
3. I don't play video games, and the only television I watch is with my wife.
4. Reading is my TV, and I read a lot. You are welcome to connect with me on [Goodreads](http://goodreads.com/JoshTellsAStory) if you have an account there.
5. I founded an online reading group called [Dads Who Read](http://DadsWhoRead.com).
6. Writing is my other passion. Mostly, I write fiction (I wrote [this novel](http://bit.ly/sarah-ann-lewis) and contribute to [this podcast](http://TelltalesWriting.com)), but I also write for [Creative Market's Medium blog](https://medium.com/building-creative-market). You can find my articles [here](https://medium.com/@JoshTellsAStory).
7. I also like to make music (I sing and play several instruments; guitar is my go-to), shoot photos, and cook, though I don't get to do any of those as often as I would like these days.
