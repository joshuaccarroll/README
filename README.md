# Hi! I'm Josh.

It's really hard to work for/with somebody you can't read. This document exists to help you read *me*. (See what I did there?) I hope it is helpful to you. If it is not, or if you feel I am misstating something here, feel free to clone this repo, create a branch, and give me a PR!

## My personality
_I love personality tests and think personality types are fascinating. Here's more than you could possibly want to know about mine._

1. The Sorting Hat sorted me into [Gryffindor](https://www.pottermore.com/collection/all-about-gryffindor).
2. My top five strengths according to Strengths Finder are: [Intellection](http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/691/intellection.aspx), [Ideation](http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/679/ideation.aspx), [Strategic](http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/718/strategic.aspx), [Connectedness](http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/649/connectedness.aspx), [Maximizer](http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/697/maximizer.aspx)
3. My Myers-Briggs type is [INTP-A](https://www.16personalities.com/intp-personality).
4. I am a weird mix of introvert and extravert. I recharge in solitude, and I prefer small, intimate gatherings of close family and friends to social events, large family gatherings, meetups, and parties. But I am also totally comfortable being on stage, whether that's public speaking or performing.

## How I communicate
_I have quirks. Here they are._

1. **I need the big picture and the _why_ before I can understand the details.** If you ask me to help you think through some code (and you should!), I will first need to understand what the project is supposed to accomplish before I am capable of helping you think through syntax, patterns, or strategy. Remember that math teacher who annoyed you by explaining why an equation works rather than just telling you to memorize the equation? I'm the reason that teacher exists. I am literally incapable of just memorizing and applying.
2. **I tend to think out loud.** This means that sometimes I am just throwing ideas at the wall rather than giving orders. It means that I may ramble. I am actively working to get better at (A) stating clearly whether I am dreaming or giving direction, (B) staying focused on the topic at hand, and (C) speaking concisely. If you feel I am getting off track (especially in a 1:1), you have my permission to (please) interrupt me. I value correction, and I will thank you for it.
3. **I do not speak between the lines.** Please do not read between them. I will be direct when I am giving feedback. If you think you are hearing something implied that I am not explicitly saying, you are always welcome to ask.
4. **I despise passive aggression.** I will not treat you that way. Ever. If you have a beef with me or another coworker, _that is 100% okay._ Please talk it out with me directly. If the problem is with me, I will thank you for your feedback and work to be better. That is my promise. If the problem is with someone else, I am more than happy to give you direction/advice on how to resolve an issue with a coworker, and I will even help to facilitate a discussion. But you should know that I will also ask if you have spoken to that person directly, and if you have not, I will encourage you to do so.
5. **When I get excited, I can sometimes steamroll a conversation.** I am working to overcome _Habit #2: Adding too much value_, "The overwhelming desire to add [my] two cents to every discussion" from [this book](https://www.amazon.com/What-Got-Here-Wont-There-ebook/dp/B000Q9J128). This means that I might front-load my opinions before giving others a chance to share theirs, ask questions only so I can share my answers, or interrupt and finish your sentence (often incorrectly) when I agree with what (I think) you are saying. Know that this comes from my enthusiasm and not some malignant place. But it is also not acceptable. So if you see me doing these things, please raise a hand and/or interrupt me and say "Josh, you're doing that thing again." I want to get better, and I value your help.
