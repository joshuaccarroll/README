# Hi! I'm Josh.
### And I'm a Senior Engineering Manager at [Stoa](https://flipos.com/).

It's really hard to work for/with somebody you can't read. This document exists to help you read *me*. I hope it is helpful to you. If it is not, or if you feel I am misstating something here, let me know! This is a work in progress, _as am I._

## TL;DR:
* I love the creative process and problem solving. It is my passion to help engineers and creators grow and thrive however I can.
* I believe in honest, direct feedback. I will give it, and I want to receive it.
* I am a big picture guy who needs the _why_ before the _what_ and the _how_.
* I am logical and action oriented. I prefer to think (which I usually do out loud) before making decisions, but then I want to act quickly.
* I am a husband/dad/foster dad with many creative hobbies. I recharge my batteries by finding solitude, reading, writing, making music, and (ironically for an introvert) performing.

## My work vision
_It is my job and my privilege to help our engineering team become the most amazing version of itself. Here is what that looks like:_

1. I believe the best engineers excel, not only at **engineering,** but also at **thinking and communicating.** Engineers put just as much effort into project planning, estimating, and communicating as they do into implementing technical solutions. Engineers can and should raise the level of the entire team, and in turn, the company and the product. I will do whatever I can to level each of us up in all of these areas.
2. I believe in **straightforward, honest, compassionate communication.** If you are unclear about something, ask. If something doesn't feel right, just speak up. My goal is to be a safe and empathetic sounding board for anybody on the team. It is not only okay to **say the thing,** it is your job and mine to be as clear as possible about what is and is not working, what feels good and what does not. This is how we level up the team and the company.
3. I believe in **facilitating creative problem solving,** no matter the source. The best ideas for how to improve a thing often come from the people who are in the weeds building that thing. Got an idea? I want to hear it!
4. I believe the best engineers are those who care deeply about the customers and the product. They always look for ways to make the technology and the product better. If you see something we need to improve, **let's talk about it!**
5. I love to **align passions and skills align with company needs.** I will ask my team questions like "What would you work on if nobody was telling you what to do?" and I will ask execs and product managers questions like "What project would you start if you had a engineers to build it?" If there's alignment and it makes sense, I will work hard to connect the right people to the project.

## What I don't do
_I do a lot of things, but not everything. I will not..._
1. **Talk around what I need to say.** I will be very clear with you, and I expect you to be clear with me as well. If it feels like I am being vague, say so. We are all adults, and I will do my best to facilitate proactive and with mature communication.
2. **Micromanage you.** You were hired to be an expert, and you have my trust. I will give you feedback, and I will listen. You are always welcome to disagree. I may have to occasionally make a decision that you disagree with, and I will expect you to disagree and commit. But if you ever feel that I am ingoring your expertise or that you are not being heard, please say so!
3. **Do your job** My job is to empower engineers to create great solutions, not to implement those solutions myself.

## How I communicate
_I have quirks. Here they are._

1. **I will do my best to communicate with you in a way that sets you up for success.** If you need me to be more direct, I will do so. If you need me to give you more encouragement, I am happy to oblige! If something isn't feeling right about the way I am working/communicating with you, let me know, and I will adjust.
2. **I will not lie.** There may be times that I am required to withhold information. That's the nature of the job. But I will not be dishonest with you.
3. **I do not speak between the lines.** Please do not read between them. I will do my best to be direct and clear when giving feedback. If you think you are hearing something implied that I am not explicitly saying, you are always welcome to ask!
4. **I dislike passive aggression.** I will not be passive agressive with you, ever, and I ask the same in return. If you have an issue with me or another coworker, _that is 100% okay._ Let's talk it out! If the problem is with me, I will thank you for your feedback and work to resolve the issue with you and be better. That is my promise.
5. **I need the _why_ before I can understand the details.** I need to understand what the project is supposed to accomplish before I will be capable of thinking about planning, patterns, or strategy.
6. **I tend to think out loud.** This means that sometimes I am just throwing ideas at the wall rather than giving directions, and I may even ramble. If you feel I am getting off track (especially in a 1:1), you have my permission to (please) interrupt me! I value correction, and I will thank you for it.
7. **When I get excited, I can sometimes overwhelm a conversation.** I have come a long way, but in the past I have been known to occasionally get excited and take over a conversation when it would be better to listen. Again, if you catch me doing this, please say so.


## My personality
_I am a sucker for personality tests, and I think personality types are fascinating. Here's more than you could possibly want to know about mine._

1. The Sorting Hat sorted me into [Gryffindor](https://www.pottermore.com/collection/all-about-gryffindor).
2. My top five strengths according to Strengths Finder are: [Intellection](http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/691/intellection.aspx), [Ideation](http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/679/ideation.aspx), [Strategic](http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/718/strategic.aspx), [Connectedness](http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/649/connectedness.aspx), [Maximizer](http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/697/maximizer.aspx).
3. My Myers-Briggs type is [INTP-A](https://www.16personalities.com/intp-personality) (Individual traits: Introverted – 51%, Intuitive – 80%, Thinking – 58%, Prospecting – 69%, Assertive – 71%).
4. My Enneagram type is a [4 with a 3 wing](https://www.crystalknows.com/enneagram/type-4-wing-3).
5. I am a weird mix of introvert and extravert. I recharge in solitude, and I prefer small, intimate gatherings of close family and friends to social events, large family gatherings, meetups, and parties. But I am also totally comfortable being on stage, whether that's public speaking or making music.

## I have a life beyond work
_And it's a little crazy._

1. My wife and I have been married for almost twenty years, and we're finally beginning to figure each other out.
2. We have two biological daughters and two foster daughters. The youngest is three years old, the oldest is sixteen. If I seem tired, this is almost certainly why. :)
3. I don't play video games, and I only watch a little television. I do my best to stay caught up on MCU and Star Wars, though, so feel free to discuss your fan theories with me!
4. Reading is my TV, and I read a lot. You are welcome to connect with me on [Goodreads](http://goodreads.com/JoshTellsAStory) if you have an account there.
5. Writing and music are my primary creative outlets. I wrote [this novel](http://bit.ly/sarah-ann-lewis) and [this song](https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/joshtellsastory/heres-a-boy-2) (I sing and play several instruments; guitar and ukulele are my go-tos). I also dabble in photography and cooking, though I don't get to do either of those as often as I would like these days.
