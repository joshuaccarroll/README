# Hi! I'm Josh.

It's really hard to work for/with somebody you can't read. This document exists to help you read *me*. I hope it is helpful! If not, or if you feel I am misstating something here, feel free to clone this repo, create a branch, and give me a PR!

## My personality type
_I love personality tests and think personality types are fascinating. Here's more than you could possibly want to know about mine._

1. The Sorting Hat sorted me into [Gryffindor](https://www.pottermore.com/collection/all-about-gryffindor).
2. My top five strengths according to Strengths Finder are: [Intellection](http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/691/intellection.aspx), [Ideation](http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/679/ideation.aspx), [Strategic](http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/718/strategic.aspx), [Connectedness](http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/649/connectedness.aspx), [Maximizer](http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/697/maximizer.aspx)
3. My Myers-Briggs type is [INTP-A](https://www.16personalities.com/intp-personality).
4. I am a weird mix of introvert and extravert. I recharge in solitude, and I prefer small, intimate gatherings of close family and friends to social events, large family gatherings, meetups, and parties. But I am also totally comfortable being on stage, whether that's public speaking or performing.
